# Generating-Persian-Poems-Using-a-Tiny-GPT-like-Model

## Overview

The Persian Poem Generator is a machine learning project that utilizes a GPT-like language model to generate coherent and creative Persian poetry. By leveraging advanced natural language processing techniques and a character-level tokenizer, this project aims to produce poetic verses that reflect the beauty and intricacies of the Persian language.

## Features

### Character-Level Tokenization: 
The model employs a character-level tokenizer, allowing it to capture the nuances of the Persian script and generate text character by character.

### Flexible Text Generation: 
Users can specify a starting word and adjust parameters such as temperature, top-k, and top-p sampling to influence the creativity and randomness of the generated poetry.

### Post-Processing: 
The generated text undergoes post-processing to ensure coherence, proper formatting, and adherence to poetic structures.

### Interactive Interface: 
The project is designed to be user-friendly, enabling users to easily generate poetry through a simple command-line interface or Jupyter notebook.

## Installation
To set up the Persian Poem Generator, follow these steps:
Clone the Repository:
bash
git clone git@github.com:alicmu2024/Generating-Persian-Poems-Using-a-Tiny-GPT-like-Model.git

### Install Required Libraries:
